84-121123-0000 GO DO YOU HEAR
84-121123-0001 BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT
84-121123-0002 AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY
84-121123-0003 AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE
84-121123-0004 D'AVRIGNY RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE
84-121123-0005 D'AVRIGNY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN
84-121123-0006 FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS
84-121123-0007 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR
84-121123-0008 OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE
84-121123-0009 DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORREL
84-121123-0010 NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION
84-121123-0011 SAID MORREL SADLY YES REPLIED NOIRTIER
84-121123-0012 THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE DOOR
84-121123-0013 ASKED MORREL YES
84-121123-0014 MUST I LEAVE ALONE NO
84-121123-0015 BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU YES
84-121123-0016 GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOREVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK
84-121123-0017 MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER
84-121123-0018 MORREL SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM
84-121123-0019 THE OLD MAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
84-121123-0020 IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF NOIRTIER WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS
84-121123-0021 BUT HE STOPPED ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER
84-121123-0022 THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE
84-121123-0023 NOIRTIER WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE
84-121123-0024 THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOSED THE LIPS
84-121123-0025 THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN ABBE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS
84-121123-0026 D'AVRIGNY SAID VILLEFORT BE SO KIND I BESEECH YOU AS TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM
84-121123-0027 I ONLY WISH TO BE ALONE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME WILL YOU NOT
84-121123-0028 I AM GOING SIR AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS WILL BE MORE FERVENT THAN MINE
84-121550-0000 BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES
84-121550-0001 ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL
84-121550-0002 THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
84-121550-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
84-121550-0004 YE ARE NEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST
84-121550-0005 SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELLING BUT THE PSALM DELECTASTI GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT
84-121550-0006 THE GOOD SUPREME SOLE IN ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANSEL OF ETERNAL PEACE
84-121550-0007 BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
84-121550-0008 THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOUR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE
84-121550-0009 BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
84-121550-0010 NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
84-121550-0011 NOW HELICON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR URANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
84-121550-0012 THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES
84-121550-0013 AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DELIA'S GIRDLE
84-121550-0014 THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTERMOST APART
84-121550-0015 THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
84-121550-0016 NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E'ER GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE
84-121550-0017 THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
84-121550-0018 THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN
84-121550-0019 IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
84-121550-0020 AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERDICTED
84-121550-0021 AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VENI SPONSA DE LIBANO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
84-121550-0022 AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
84-121550-0023 TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
84-121550-0024 TO SAY UNTO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRACHM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
84-121550-0025 DANTE BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET AWHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEED'ST MUST WEEP
84-121550-0026 I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
84-121550-0027 LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICE
84-121550-0028 YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
84-121550-0029 THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOLE BE OF ONE MEASURE
84-121550-0030 BUT BY THE LARGESS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
84-121550-0031 AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
84-121550-0032 SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION
84-121550-0033 CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
84-121550-0034 WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO
84-121550-0035 AND WHAT ALLUREMENTS OR WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
174-50561-0000 FORGOTTEN TOO THE NAME OF GILLIAN THE LOVELY CAPTIVE
174-50561-0001 WORSE AND WORSE HE IS EVEN PRESUMED TO BE THE CAPTIVE'S SWEETHEART WHO WHEEDLES THE FLOWER THE RING AND THE PRISON KEY OUT OF THE STRICT VIRGINS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES AND FLIES WITH HER AT LAST IN HIS SHALLOP ACROSS THE SEA TO LIVE WITH HER HAPPILY EVER AFTER
174-50561-0002 BUT THIS IS A FALLACY
174-50561-0003 THE WANDERING SINGER APPROACHES THEM WITH HIS LUTE
174-50561-0004 THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER
174-50561-0005 LADY LADY MY ROSE WHITE LADY BUT WILL YOU NOT HEAR A ROUNDEL LADY
174-50561-0006 O IF YOU PLAY US A ROUNDEL SINGER HOW CAN THAT HARM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER
174-50561-0007 SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK THOUGH WE DANCED A WEEK WITH HER THOUGHTS A THOUSAND LEAGUES OVER THE WATER SINGER SINGER WANDERING SINGER O MY HONEY SWEET SINGER
174-50561-0008 BUT IF I PLAY YOU A ROUNDEL LADY GET ME A GIFT FROM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER HER FINGER RING FOR MY FINGER BRING THOUGH SHE'S PLEDGED A THOUSAND LEAGUES OVER THE WATER LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY O MY ROSE WHITE LADY
174-50561-0009 THE WANDERING SINGER
174-50561-0010 BUT I DID ONCE HAVE THE LUCK TO HEAR AND SEE THE LADY PLAYED IN ENTIRETY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN GRANTED LEAVE TO PLAY JUST ONE MORE GAME BEFORE BED TIME AND OF COURSE THEY CHOSE THE LONGEST AND PLAYED IT WITHOUT MISSING A SYLLABLE
174-50561-0011 THE LADIES IN YELLOW DRESSES STAND AGAIN IN A RING ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER AND ARE FOR THE LAST TIME ACCOSTED BY THE SINGER WITH HIS LUTE
174-50561-0012 THE WANDERING SINGER
174-50561-0013 I'LL PLAY FOR YOU NOW NEATH THE APPLE BOUGH AND YOU SHALL DREAM ON THE LAWN SO SHADY LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY O MY APPLE GOLD LADY
174-50561-0014 THE LADIES
174-50561-0015 NOW YOU MAY PLAY A SERENA SINGER A DREAM OF NIGHT FOR AN APPLE GOLD LADY FOR THE FRUIT IS NOW ON THE APPLE BOUGH AND THE MOON IS UP AND THE LAWN IS SHADY SINGER SINGER WANDERING SINGER O MY HONEY SWEET SINGER
174-50561-0016 ONCE MORE THE SINGER PLAYS AND THE LADIES DANCE BUT ONE BY ONE THEY FALL ASLEEP TO THE DROWSY MUSIC AND THEN THE SINGER STEPS INTO THE RING AND UNLOCKS THE TOWER AND KISSES THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER
174-50561-0017 I DON'T KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF THE LADIES
174-50561-0018 BED TIME CHILDREN
174-50561-0019 YOU SEE THE TREATMENT IS A TRIFLE FANCIFUL
174-84280-0000 HOW WE MUST SIMPLIFY
174-84280-0001 IT SEEMS TO ME MORE AND MORE AS I LIVE LONGER THAT MOST POETRY AND MOST LITERATURE AND PARTICULARLY THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST IS DISCORDANT WITH THE VASTNESS AND VARIETY THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES AND RECUPERATIONS OF LIFE AS WE LIVE IT TO DAY
174-84280-0002 IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE UNDER CRUDER AND MORE RIGID CONDITIONS THAN OURS LIVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND HATED MORE NAIVELY AGED SOONER AND DIED YOUNGER THAN WE DO
174-84280-0003 WE RANGE WIDER LAST LONGER AND ESCAPE MORE AND MORE FROM INTENSITY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING
174-84280-0004 AND ALREADY THIS ASTOUNDING BLOW BEGINS TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG OTHER EVENTS AS A THING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE INDEED BUT RELATED TO ALL THE STRANGENESS AND MYSTERY OF LIFE PART OF THE UNIVERSAL MYSTERIES OF DESPAIR AND FUTILITY AND DEATH THAT HAVE TROUBLED MY CONSCIOUSNESS SINCE CHILDHOOD
174-84280-0005 FOR A TIME THE DEATH OF MARY OBSCURED HER LIFE FOR ME BUT NOW HER LIVING PRESENCE IS MORE IN MY MIND AGAIN
174-84280-0006 IT WAS THAT IDEA OF WASTE THAT DOMINATED MY MIND IN A STRANGE INTERVIEW I HAD WITH JUSTIN
174-84280-0007 I BECAME GROTESQUELY ANXIOUS TO ASSURE HIM THAT INDEED SHE AND I HAD BEEN AS THEY SAY INNOCENT THROUGHOUT OUR LAST DAY TOGETHER
174-84280-0008 YOU WERE WRONG IN ALL THAT I SAID SHE KEPT HER FAITH WITH YOU
174-84280-0009 WE NEVER PLANNED TO MEET AND WHEN WE MET
174-84280-0010 IF WE HAD BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING
174-84280-0011 BUT NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER VERY MUCH
174-84280-0012 AND IT IS UPON THIS EFFECT OF SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES CAUGHT IN THE NET OF ANIMAL JEALOUSIES AND THOUGHTLESS MOTIVES AND ANCIENT RIGID INSTITUTIONS THAT I WOULD END THIS WRITING
174-84280-0013 IN MARY IT SEEMS TO ME I FOUND BOTH WOMANHOOD AND FELLOWSHIP I FOUND WHAT MANY HAVE DREAMT OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP FREELY GIVEN AND I COULD DO NOTHING BUT CLUTCH AT HER TO MAKE HER MY POSSESSION
174-84280-0014 WHAT ALTERNATIVE WAS THERE FOR HER
174-84280-0015 SHE WAS DESTROYED NOT MERELY BY THE UNCONSIDERED UNDISCIPLINED PASSIONS OF HER HUSBAND AND HER LOVER BUT BY THE VAST TRADITION THAT SUSTAINS AND ENFORCES THE SUBJUGATION OF HER SEX
174-168635-0000 HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND
174-168635-0001 THE HEART OF THAT EX CONVICT WAS FULL OF VIRGINITY
174-168635-0002 HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VAGUE AND FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM
174-168635-0003 HE SUFFERED ALL THE PANGS OF A MOTHER AND HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT MEANT FOR THAT GREAT AND SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF A HEART WHICH BEGINS TO LOVE IS A VERY OBSCURE AND A VERY SWEET THING
174-168635-0004 ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT
174-168635-0005 COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING POOR LITTLE THING
174-168635-0006 SHE FELT THAT WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A SENSATION OF EXPANSION
174-168635-0007 THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLD OR POOR SHE THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HOVEL PRETTY
174-168635-0008 NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GULF BETWEEN JEAN VALJEAN AND COSETTE DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GULF
174-168635-0009 TO MEET WAS TO FIND EACH OTHER
174-168635-0010 WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY
174-168635-0011 MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL
174-168635-0012 HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN
174-168635-0013 WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK THESE TWO BEINGS LED A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HOVEL
174-168635-0014 COSETTE WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MOURNING
174-168635-0015 AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER AND HE MADE HER PRAY
174-168635-0016 HE PASSED HOURS IN WATCHING HER DRESSING AND UNDRESSING HER DOLL AND IN LISTENING TO HER PRATTLE
174-168635-0017 THE BEST OF US ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM EGOTISTICAL THOUGHTS
174-168635-0018 HE HAD RETURNED TO PRISON THIS TIME FOR HAVING DONE RIGHT HE HAD QUAFFED FRESH BITTERNESS DISGUST AND LASSITUDE WERE OVERPOWERING HIM EVEN THE MEMORY OF THE BISHOP PROBABLY SUFFERED A TEMPORARY ECLIPSE THOUGH SURE TO REAPPEAR LATER ON LUMINOUS AND TRIUMPHANT BUT AFTER ALL THAT SACRED MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM
174-168635-0019 WHO KNOWS WHETHER JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT BEEN ON THE EVE OF GROWING DISCOURAGED AND OF FALLING ONCE MORE
174-168635-0020 ALAS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISION THAN COSETTE
174-168635-0021 HE PROTECTED HER AND SHE STRENGTHENED HIM
174-168635-0022 HE WAS THAT CHILD'S STAY AND SHE WAS HIS PROP
